The model is to big to save here.  Once trained through Google Collab the following
files should be saved in this directory:

config.json
merges.txt
special_tokens_map.json
tf_model.h5
tokenizer.json
tokenizer_config.json
vocab.json


This folder needs to get loaded into the EC2 instance for the docker building 
that takes place.
